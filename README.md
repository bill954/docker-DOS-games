# docker-project
The objective of this project (for now) is to use containers to host different games and make them playable from a web browser.

To do things:
- ~~Create another container to host a static webpage that will redirect to any of these games.~~
- The container is running ok, but the static webpage is not finished yet.
- ~~write a docker-compose.yml file to run all the containers at once.~~
- docker-compose written but still unfinished. We need to add lines to the .yml to copy the main page .html inside the web container.

Optional objectives (we're not doing these but just in case we have that much time'):
- Add other interesting games (prince of persia maybe)
- Make the docker-compose able to run in Azure Container Instances.
