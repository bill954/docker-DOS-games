# docker-project
The objective of this project (for now) is to use containers to host different games and make them playable from a web browser.

To do things:
- Create another container to host a static webpage that will redirect to any of these games.
- Write a docker-compose.yml file to run all the containers at once.

Optional objectives (we're not doing these but just in case we have that much time'):
- Add other interesting games (prince of persia maybe)
- Make the docker-compose able to run in Azure Container Instances.
