# Game Files
The game_build_files folder has folders inside, each with a dockerfile that sets up a container image for each game. Each dockerfile downloads the .zip that contains the DOS game from the web (except Mario, which works differently).
The compressed_games folder holds copies of each game's .zip file. These .zip are not being used now, but they're still here to used in case some of the download link is down or we decide to load the games locally.
