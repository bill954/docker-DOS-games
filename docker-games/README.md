# Game Files
This folder contains:
- game_build_files which contains folders inside, each with its own `.Dockerfile` that sets up a container image for each individual game listed. Each `.Dockerfile` downloads a compressed .zip file (except in the case of Infinite Mario Bros) which can be found in the compressed_games folder
- compressed_games holds copies of each of the games' compressed .zip files, these links are not currently being used for download but are here in case a download link goes down or in case you'd like to load the game locally.
